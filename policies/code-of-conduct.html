The Devs Connect community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the Devs Connect organisers. Please see our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D5vYEahOJ5oFkxQyqU2zmwGrsu1cMgXXUm0bctzamw/edit?usp=sharing">Inclusion and Diversity Statement</a></p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Devs Connect event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the Devs Connect coordinators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the Devs Connect community, and/or removal from an event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Devs Connect coordinator immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.</p>

<p>Be mindful that this might be the first time a speaker is publicly speaking, please give them your respect and patience, and help us create a safe space. Likewise, at an event or in Slack, those asking questions or sharing links might be doing so for the first time in this space, and may find it very difficult or stressful. Please be kind and supportive. We want everyone to feel welcome and able to communicate openly whilst respecting everyone else at the event.</p>

<p>The Devs Connect coordinators and event organisers are <a href="https://www.meetup.com/devsconnect/members/?op=leaders">listed in the Meetup.com group</a> and can be contacted individually or as a group. You can also <a href="https://www.devsconnect.org/requests/join-slack.html">contact them in the Slack workspace</a>.</p>

<p>If you have questions or feedback about this Code of Conduct please contact the coordinators.</p>
